    square arena from the bird's eye point of view
    in said arena we have robots whose tasks is to defeat other robots and stay alive
    robots attack each other by shooting projectiles, which a physical objects that

      travel at a specific constant speed till they collide with something or
       fly out of the visible map

    robots must navigate within specified arena which does not take up the whole
    visible screen
    if a robot leaves the arena they must return else they lose a life
    in said arena there walls though which robots nor projectiles can move though
    robots can however move though other robots


    robots have the  action to shoot
    the shoots action has rest timer cooldown which must decrease to zero before
    a said action can be used by the robot again


    robots have a limited amount of lives
    if a robot is hit by a projectile they lose a life and are revived on a random available
    point in the map
    robot after revivals has couple of seconds of invincibility
    if a robot loses all their lives they are removed from the game and are no longer revived
    robots can move though their own projectiles without losing one of their lives


    a robot has a front where they have cannon from which they shoot projectiles away from themselves
    robots can turn this front at specified speed
    robots have information about their surroundings only from a cone facing from their front


    The movement of the robot is dynamic and has the option to move in 4 directions: up, down, left, right
    these directions are defined from the perspective of the camera looking at the game, not from the robots front perspective
    robots can combine these movements to create diagonal movements


    Robots have the ability to "dash" which adds momentum to the robots current direction of movement
    The ability dash has a cooldown
    The ability dash must have its cooldown tick to 0 before repeated use and the robot must be in motion


    on the map in random intervales special objects called "powerups" will spawn
    if a robot collides with this powerup they will receive a special effect and the object will disappear
    these effects include shortening of a cooldown timer, or increasing the movement of an object such a projectile or even the robot itself
    these effects can be negative and have the opposite effect
    after some time these objects will disappear on their own even without being collected


    Games begins with the placement of robots inside the arena on predetermined spots
    Robots then immediately receive the freedom of controls
    And with the beginning a game limit timer starts ticking down
    Games end with timer running out or with 1 or less robots being alive


    Robots are scored according to:
      whether they were the last one alive
      how many other robots they have defeated
      how many lives they had left
      how long they stayed alive
    Best robots are selected according to the score and selected for creation of a new generations of robots
